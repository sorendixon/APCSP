    <p>Hola mis amigos, I play soccer and lacrosse for my highschool, Piedmont High. I was born in Berkeley. I've always lived in and Piedmont and I have two older brothers (one is a ginger). My brother is recently engaged. I'm hoping to go to college in southern California either at UCLA or UCSB. I enjoy eating artichoke, however, sushi is my favorite food. I like a good rainbow roll because of the diversity of fish on top of the roll. I am currently graduating junior year and am hyped for senior year!</p>
