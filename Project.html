    <img class = "size" src = "solar oven.webp">
    <p>1) I really enjoyed the solar oven project from physics this year. We built solar ovens capable of baking cookies, granted it would take a long time to do so. The idea was to be able to give ovens to poor communities in 3rd world countries by utilizing their abundance of sunlight.</p>
    
    <img src = "stone soup.jfif">
    <p>2) Another project I enjoyed was the making of stone soup in 3rd grade. This was extremely fun because we had recently read a book about stone soup so this really brought it to life.</p>
